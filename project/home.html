                    Young artist QLER from the label What The Duck, known for hit songs like “Alice,” “Jai Loy,” “Like I Used to,” and “Phajan,” takes on the role of a writer in this book. He shares his personal struggles with self-doubt through heartfelt words and illustrations by ToddyInTheMood. This combination creates a warm and touching storytelling experience, offering encouragement to everyone who reads it.
                    “Because everything in this world has its own beauty, no matter the outcome. Don’t forget to take pride in what you create.”
